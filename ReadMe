# Bank application build with Javascript, HTML and CSS 
this is a bank web-application where user needs to log in with a username and a pin code to access their account. 
The user data is stored in out script file.
I have created a username function that adds a username property to each user account in our user data. 
This function gives every user an unique username property to every account.
